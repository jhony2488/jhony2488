    Hi there ðŸ‘‹
</h1>

My name is Jhonata, better known as Jhony, i love programming and everything that involves the IT area,I am currently working as a freenlance full stack developer and I am also studying systems analysis and development at [UNOPAR](http://unopar.br/) My entry into the world of development started when I was studying industrial automation technician at SENAI, in which this course allowed me to gain knowledge of all areas of integrated technology, of course it was not so deep. 

However I tried to obtain a greater knowledge in the development area and from this I dedicated myself to study web development, I did some web development work during the time. In addition to being a web developer, I am also passionate about robotics with an emphasis on both commercial and residential automation, and my thirst for knowledge and continuous development encourages me to develop more and more.

These are the technologies I use and I have mastery:

Languages: HTML5, CSS3 (SASS), JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, SQL, Dart

Frameworks: Vue.js, Nuxt.js

JavaScript Runtime: Node.js

Code versioning: Git, Github, GitLab, Azure Repos
