My name is Jhonata, better known as Jhony, i love programming and everything that involves the IT area,I am currently working as a freenlance full stack developer and I am also studying systems analysis and development at [UNOPAR](http://unopar.br/) My entry into the world of development started when I was studying industrial automation technician at SENAI, in which this course allowed me to gain knowledge of all areas of integrated technology, of course it was not so deep. 

However I tried to obtain a greater knowledge in the development area and from this I dedicated myself to study web development, I did some web development work during the time. In addition to being a web developer, I am also passionate about robotics with an emphasis on both commercial and residential automation, and my thirst for knowledge and continuous development encourages me to develop more and more.
